MultiChoiceAdapter
==================

MultiChoiceAdapter is an implementation of ListAdapter which adds support for modal multiple choice selection as in the native Gmail app. 

It provides a functionality similar to that of the [<tt>CHOICE_MODE_MULTIPLE_MODAL</tt>][1] ListView mode, with two additional benefits:

* It's easier to use, as it keeps count of the selected items, updates their background accordingly and handles checkboxes transparently.
* It is compatible with every version of Android from 2.x. Of course, this implies that your project must use [ActionBarSherlock][2].

Try out the sample application:

<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.manuelpeinado.multichoiceadapter.demo">
  <img alt="Android app on Google Play"
       src="https://developer.android.com/images/brand/en_app_rgb_wo_45.png" />
</a>

Or browse the [source code of the sample application][5] for a complete example of use.

Including in your project
-------------------------

If youâ€™re using Eclipse with the ADT plugin you can include MultiChoiceAdaptar as a library project. Create a new Android project in Eclipse using the library/ folder as the existing source. Then, open the properties of this new project and, in the 'Android' category, add a reference to the ActionBarSherlock library project. Finally, in your application project properties, add a reference to the created library project.

If you use maven to build your Android project you can simply add a dependency for this library.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.manuelpeinado.multichoiceadapter</groupId>
    <artifactId>library</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.7</version>
    <type>apklib</type>
</dependency>
```

Usage
---------

### If you need <tt>BaseAdapter</tt>-like functionality

Instead of deriving your adapter from <tt>BaseAdapter</tt> derive it from <tt>MultiChoiceBaseAdapter</tt>. You'll have to implement the usual <tt>BaseAdapter</tt> methods, but instead of implementing <tt>BaseAdapter#getView()</tt>, implement <tt>getViewImpl()</tt>. You'll also have to implement the different <tt>ActionMode.Callback</tt> methods.

Once you've implemented your class that derives from <tt>MultiChoiceBaseAdapter</tt>, you attach an instance of it to your ListView like this:

```java
multiChoiceAdapter.setAdapterView(listView);
multiChoiceAdapter.setOnItemClickListener(myItemListClickListener);
```

Do not call <tt>setOnItemClickListener()</tt> on your ListView, call it on the adapter instead.

Do not forget to derive your activity from one of the ActionBarSherlock activities, except SherlockListActivity which is not supported.

Finally, do not forget to call <tt>save(outState)</tt> from your activity's <tt>onSaveInstanceState()</tt> method. This is necessary for the selection state to be persisted across configuration changes.

### If you need <tt>SimpleCursorAdapter</tt>-like functionality

Derive your adapter from MultiChoiceSimpleCursorAdapter, implement the ActionMode.Callback methods and configure it at construction time using the different parameters of the MultiChoiceSimpleCursorAdapter constructor (cursor, from, to...)

### If you need <tt>ArrayAdapter</tt>-like functionality

Derive your adapter from <tt>MultiChoiceArrayAdapter</tt>, implement the ActionMode.Callback methods and configure it at construction time using the different parameters of the <tt>MultiChoiceArrayAdapter</tt> constructor (<tt>layoutResourceId</tt>, <tt>textViewResourceId</tt>).

Checkboxes
------------------

MultiChoiceAdapter handles list items with check-boxes transparently. Just add a CheckBox to your item's XML layout and give it the id <tt>android.R.id.checkbox</tt>.

Customization
---------------------

You can use a **custom background** (drawable or color) for the selected items of your list. To do so, add an item named <tt>multiChoiceAdapterStyle</tt> to your theme, and have it reference an additional style which you define like this:

```xml
<style name="MyCustomMultiChoiceAdapter">
    <item name="selectedItemBackground">@color/my_custom_selected_item_background</item>
</style>
```

See the sample application for a complete example.

You can also customize the way the adapter behaves when an item is clicked and **the action mode was already active**. Just add the following item to your style:

```xml
<style name="MyCustomMultiChoiceAdapter">
    <item name="itemClickInActionMode">selectItem</item>
</style>
```
    
Two values are supported:

* <tt>selectItem</tt>. Changes the selection state of the clicked item, just as if it had been long clicked. This is what the native MULTICHOICE_MODAL mode of List does, and what almost every app does, and thus the default value.
* <tt>openItem</tt>. Opens the clicked item, just as if it had been clicked outside of the action mode. This is what the native Gmail app does.


Libraries used
--------------------

* [ActionBarSherlock][2] by Jake Wharton
* The sample app uses the [ProviGen library][6] by Timothee Jeannin

Who's using it
--------------
* [My App List][7]. With this app you can save installed applications in a list to restore them after flash or install a new ROM.
